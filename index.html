     <h1> Home </h1>
     <p> Welcome everyone! Before we start, have you ever wanted to know what a computer is and how it works? Well, if you do, you have come to the right place!
         Our group, Luca, Harshil, Nima and Jack have taken apart and put together a computer! We will be teaching you the main parts of the computer while
         providing pictures of our process. </p>

    <h2> CPU / Central Processing Unit </h2>
    <p> Let us start off with the CPU. The CPU is the short form for Central Processing Unit. Below is how the CPU looks from our PC. We have the Intel
        Pentium 4th Generation. Our CPU has only 1 core while in this generation we have Intel Core i9 which has 18 cores! The CPU is the brain of the computer.
        It takes input in binary form, processes the information and then outputs the results to a output device. </p>
    <h2> CPU Cooling Fan </h2>
    <p> When the CPU is processing the information, it uses a lot of energy, which then converts into heat. To deal with the heat, the CPU has a cooling fan.
        The CPU cooling fan is located on the top of the CPU so that the CPU can be attatched to the motherboard. As processors increase in speed, the PC is prone to 
        overheating. To control the speed of the fan, a BIOS (basic input/output system) is used. </p>
    <h2> Motherboard </h2>
    <p> The motherboard is a giant circuit board with metallic parts, transistors, and condensers. It it responsible for allowing all the parts of a computer, 
        such as the CPU, the RAM, and any expansion cards. It is arguably one of the most important components of a computer, as the computer's parts simply
        would not be able to communicate with each other without it. </p>
    <h2> The Hard Drive / Hard Disk Drive </h2>
    <p>  The hard drive is responsible for all the storage done on the computer. Every time you create, save or download a file onto your computer, 
         it is saved in a hard drive. When a computer boots for the first time, it has to format the one or more hard drives to be able to store 
         information. The operating system of the computer is also stored on a hard drive. Operating systems can take varying amounts of space, 
         from less than one gigabyte to over 100! However, the operating system is a necessary part of using computer. Besides the operating system 
         and necessary system files, you can store whatever you want on your hard drive! Files, documents, games and more. They are your treasure 
         chest of anything you want. </p>
    <h2> CD Drive </h2> 
    <p> A CD drive is a device a computer uses to read data using binary. A CD drive is usually put inside a computer's body with an slot for the disc tray access connected to one of the computer's 
        ports. The first CD drives read data at just 150 kilobytes per second. This became known as "1X." By the 2000s, "52X" CD drives could transfer data at up to 7.8 megabytes per second.
    <h2> Power Supply </h2>
    <p> The power supply is what is says in the name. It provides the power to run the PC. When you connect your PC to the wall, the wall outlet is a high-voltage AC. However, computers use low-voltage
        DC. All the components need DC power to run. Any power supply come in 2 types: linear and switching. A computer uses switching power supplies. The switching power supply: converts AC to DC, provide
        DC voltage to the components and provide cooling and maintains air flow through the case. 
   <h2> The RAM, or Random Access Memory </h2>
   <p> The RAM, or random access memory is a very important component of the computer.  It acts as storage for programs that the computer needs to use right at that moment. When a computer needs to perform 
       a task, it loads all necessary files into the RAM. Having more RAM gives your computer the ability to handle more tasks at once. RAM speed is also important, as it can improve your computerâ€™s overall 
       speed. </p>
