     <p> Welcome everyone! Before we start, have you ever wanted to know what a computer is and how it works? Well, if you do, you have come to the right place!
         Our group, Luca, Harshil, Nima and Jack have taken apart and put together a computer! We will be teaching you the main parts of the computer while
         providing pictures of our process. </p>

    <h2> CPU / Central Processing Unit </h2>
    <p> Let us start off with the CPU. The CPU is the short form for Central Processing Unit. Below is how the CPU looks from our PC. We have the Intel
        Pentium 4th Generation. Our CPU has only 1 core while in this generation we have Intel Core i9 which has 18 cores! The CPU is the brain of the computer.
        It takes input in binary form, processes the information and then outputs the results to a output device.                                                                                                                                                                             </p>
