     <h1> Home </h1>
     <p> Welcome everyone! Before we start, have you ever wanted to know what a computer is and how it works? Well, if you do, you have come to the right place!
         Our group, Luca, Harshil, Nima and Jack have taken apart and put together a computer! We will be teaching you the main parts of the computer while
         providing pictures of our process. </p>

    <h2> CPU / Central Processing Unit </h2>
    <p> Let us start off with the CPU. The CPU is the short form for Central Processing Unit. Below is how the CPU looks from our PC. We have the Intel
        Pentium 4th Generation. Our CPU has only 1 core while in this generation we have Intel Core i9 which has 18 cores! The CPU is the brain of the computer.
        It takes input in binary form, processes the information and then outputs the results to a output device. </p>
    <h2> CPU Cooling Fan </h2>
    <p> When the CPU is processing the information, it uses a lot of energy, which then converts into heat. To deal with the heat, the CPU has a cooling fan.
        The CPU cooling fan is located on the top of the CPU so that the CPU can be attatched to the motherboard. As processors increase in speed, the PC is prone to 
        overheating. To control the speed of the fan, a BIOS (basic input/output system) is used. </p>
    <h2> CD Drive </h2> 
    <p> A CD drive is a device a computer uses to read data using binary. A CD drive is usually put inside a computer's body with an slot for the disc tray access connected to one of the computer's 
        ports. The first CD drives read data at just 150 kilobytes per second. This became known as "1X." By the 2000s, "52X" CD drives could transfer data at up to 7.8 megabytes per second.
