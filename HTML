     <h1> Home </h1>
     <p> Welcome everyone! Before we start, have you ever wanted to know what a computer is and how it works? Well, if you do, you have come to the right place!
         Our group, Luca, Harshil, Nima and Jack have taken apart and put together a computer! We will be teaching you the main parts of the computer while
         providing pictures of our process. </p>

    <h2> CPU / Central Processing Unit </h2>
    <p> Let us start off with the CPU. The CPU is the short form for Central Processing Unit. Below is how the CPU looks from our PC. We have the Intel
        Pentium 4th Generation. Our CPU has only 1 core while in this generation we have Intel Core i9 which has 18 cores! The CPU is the brain of the computer.
        It takes input in binary form, processes the information and then outputs the results to a output device. </p>
    <h2> The Motherboard </h2>
    <p> The motherboard is a giant circuit board with metallic parts, transistors, and condensers. It it responsible for allowing all the parts of a computer, 
        such as the CPU, the RAM, and any expansion cards. It is arguably one of the most important components of a computer, as the computer's parts simply
        would not be able to communicate with each other without it. </p>
